    "When the goal is training a model (4), it might seem easy to ad-hoc work through 1-3. _Let's be honest - it's what we do most of the time._ But then, when a model version proves useful, many compromises are needed to get 5-7 to ~~work~~ - it rarely works correctly.\n",

    "- you could make careful decision during 1-3 that could essentially automate 5-7 seemlessly?\n",

    "BigQuery is a data warehouse right?  That seems perfect for 1-3 ... until you have fast changing data and low latency serving needs.  Actually, its perfect for this as well.  Let's proceed and discover together!\n"
