# /Transfer Learning/text/readme.md

Transfer Learning for text.  Many models exist that are already trained on large training data sets of curated text.  These are great starting points for fit for purpose projects with text!  This series of examples will build upon pre-trained BERT language models to create a classification model for sentiment.

Plan:
- Train Locally
- Training Job - single node CPU
- Training Job - single node CPU + GPU
- Training Job - single node CPU + multi GPU
- Training Job - multi node + multi GPU
- Training Job - multi node + multi GPU + reduction server
