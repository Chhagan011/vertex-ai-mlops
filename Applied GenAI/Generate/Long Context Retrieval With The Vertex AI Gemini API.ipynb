    "# Long Context Retrieval With The Vertex AI Gemini API\n",
    "\n",
    "**Retrieval - the task of retrieving information as context for an LLM**, like the Gemini family on Vertex AI. Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is the task of retrieving relevant context and then providing it along with the prompt to the LLM. \n",
    "\n",
    "[Long context](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/long-context) is a way of providing full-length sources to the LLM, which can then perform its own retrieval.  Gemini 1.5 Flash (1M) and Gemini 1.5 Pro (2M) have incredible input context windows (1M and 2M tokens respectively) and have shown [near-perfect retrieval of > 99%](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/gemini/gemini_v1_5_report.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "For a complete overview of the Gemini API, check out the companion workflow [Vertex AI Gemini API](./Vertex%20AI%20Gemini%20API.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Case Exploration**\n",
    "\n",
    "Buying a home usually involves borrowing money from a lending institution, typically through a mortgage secured by the home's value. But how do these institutions manage the risks associated with such large loans, and how are lending standards established?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the United States, two government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) play a vital role in the housing market:\n",
    "- Federal National Mortgage Association ([Fannie Mae](https://www.fanniemae.com/))\n",
    "- Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ([Freddie Mac](https://www.freddiemac.com/))\n",
    "\n",
    "These GSEs purchase mortgages from lenders, enabling those lenders to offer more loans. This process also allows Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to set standards for mortgages, ensuring they are responsible and borrowers are more likely to repay them. This system makes homeownership more affordable and stabilizes the housing market by maintaining a steady flow of liquidity for lenders and keeping interest rates controlled.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, navigating the complexities of these GSEs and their extensive servicing guides can be challenging. What if you could directly query these guides and get precise answers without needing to design a complex RAG architecture?\n",
    "\n",
    "This workflow leverages the long context capabilities of Vertex AI Gemini models and the efficiency of context caching to provide low-latency and cost-effective access to these comprehensive documents. Explore the implementation below!\n",
    "\n",

       "Getting a mortgage involves a multi-step process. Here's a breakdown of the key steps:\n",
       "\n",
       "**1. Check Your Credit Score and Report:**\n",
       "\n",
       "* **Request your credit report:** Get your free annual credit report from each of the three major credit bureaus (Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion) at AnnualCreditReport.com.  Review them for errors and dispute any inaccuracies.\n",
       "* **Check your credit score:**  Your credit score plays a significant role in mortgage approval and interest rates.  Many credit card companies and banks provide free FICO scores.  Aim for a score of 620 or higher, although higher scores will qualify you for better rates.\n",
       "\n",
       "**2. Determine How Much You Can Afford:**\n",
       "\n",
       "* **Use online calculators:** Many mortgage calculators are available online to help you estimate how much you can borrow based on your income, debts, and down payment.\n",
       "* **Consider your debt-to-income ratio (DTI):**  Lenders look at your DTI, which compares your monthly debt payments to your gross monthly income.  A DTI of 43% or less is generally preferred.\n",
       "* **Factor in additional costs:** Remember to include property taxes, homeowner's insurance, private mortgage insurance (PMI if your down payment is less than 20%), and potential HOA fees in your budget.\n",
       "\n",
       "**3. Get Pre-Approved for a Mortgage:**\n",
       "\n",
       "* **Shop around with multiple lenders:** Compare interest rates, fees, and loan terms from different banks, credit unions, and online mortgage lenders.  Getting pre-approved gives you an idea of how much you can borrow and strengthens your offer when you find a house.\n",
       "* **Provide necessary documentation:** Lenders will require documentation such as pay stubs, tax returns, bank statements, and W-2s to verify your income and financial stability.\n",
       "\n",
       "**4. Find a Real Estate Agent (Optional but Recommended):**\n",
       "\n",
       "* A real estate agent can help you navigate the home-buying process, find properties that meet your needs, and negotiate offers.\n",
       "\n",
       "**5. Shop for a Home:**\n",
       "\n",
       "* **Consider your needs and wants:** Think about location, size, amenities, and your overall lifestyle when searching for a home.\n",
       "* **Attend open houses and schedule private showings:**  Get a feel for different properties and neighborhoods.\n",
       "\n",
       "**6. Make an Offer on a Home:**\n",
       "\n",
       "* **Work with your real estate agent to draft a competitive offer:** This includes the purchase price, contingencies (e.g., home inspection, appraisal), and closing date.\n",
       "\n",
       "**7. Secure Your Financing:**\n",
       "\n",
       "* **Finalize your mortgage application:** Once your offer is accepted, you'll complete the full mortgage application with your chosen lender.\n",
       "* **Get a home appraisal:** The lender will order an appraisal to determine the fair market value of the property.\n",
       "* **Get a home inspection:** A home inspection identifies any potential problems with the property.\n",
       "\n",
       "**8. Close on Your Mortgage:**\n",
       "\n",
       "* **Review and sign closing documents:**  This includes the mortgage note, deed, and other legal documents.\n",
       "* **Pay closing costs:** These include fees for appraisal, title insurance, loan origination, and other services.\n",
       "* **Receive the keys to your new home!**\n",
       "\n",
       "**Important Considerations:**\n",
