# Resources Created For This Folder ./MLOps

> Note: This is a hidden folder named `.resources`.  In environments like JupyterLab that don't make editing and working with hidden files easy I recommend creating a a symbolic link to this folder with the same name non-hidden.  This essentially tricks JupyterLab into thinking the contained hidden files are non-hidden. For example `ln -s .resources resources` exposes a new folder `resources` with the same files unhidden.  Commiting changes to these files leaves them in the original `.resources` folder.

## Contents:

Graphics created for this folders content are generated by [graphics.ipynb](./graphics.ipynb)
- graphics created are stored under the folder structure `./images`

Screenshots are also stored in the `./images` folder which is organized by notebook
