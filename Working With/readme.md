# vertex-ai-mlops/Working With/readme.md

A series that focuses on working with many GCP services that help build AI based applications.  This ranges from services that extract information (Document AI) to services that store for math based retrieval (Vertex AI Vector Search).  It also includes purpose built solutions that enable AI based workflows without custom ML - Like Vertex AI Search & Conversation. Of course these services get the same thorough overview as all the others in this repository and custom ML will find its way into these overviews as well!
